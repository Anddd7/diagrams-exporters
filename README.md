# diagrams-exporters

- in additional to the design phase, diagrams can aslo be used for analysis and monitoring the current architecture.
- to do that, we need to export the 'metadata' from other sources, e.g. terraform, aws cli, etc. then generate the diagrams.

**diagrams-exporters** export the metadata from existing tools, and generate the diagrams.
